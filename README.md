## Corevault

The Next Generation Of Trading.

Corevault is my first big-scale Laravel application. With Corevault, you can trade in cryptocurrencies without too much knowledge.
Using highly-secure data transfers, users can easily communicate and buy/sell currencies.

Note: this isn't a real-world application, therefore it is open-source. This is mainly a practice project.
